<h1> Voice Journal: A hold-to-speak virtual diary</h1> 
  
This is a simple hold-to-speak note-taking jornalling app that records users and transcribes their words into text then stores the text as entries. It is mainly for people like scientists or Journalists to 
keep track of progress on a project more seamlessly. Disclaimer: The idea is mine but the code is written entirely by Lovable AI since I don't know anything about voice to text or speech recognition programming. 
I used this as a project to learn some prompt enginnering.

<h1>Target users</h1>
  
This can be helpful to people in a wide variety of proffesions such as scientists, medical proffesionsals, journalists, reporters and any one who needs a simple way to organize their thoughts or progress in a 
coherent and quick way. There are probably already some variations of this available but they do not work the same way I intend for this to work (Like a digital version of tape recorders that saves entries as text)

<h1>How to use</h1>
  
Press and hold the record button and them speak into your device's microphone then release the button. Give your entry a name then hit save entry

<h1>Upcoming features</h1>
  
1. Text customiztion such as font. colour etc
2. ablity to export text files from the app 
3. Connect to NoteSum
